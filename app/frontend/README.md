# Welcome to React Router!

A modern, production-ready template for building full-stack React applications using React Router.

## Features

- 🚀 Server-side rendering
- ⚡️ Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Asset bundling and optimization
- 🔄 Data loading and mutations
- 🔒 TypeScript by default
- 🎉 TailwindCSS for styling
- 📖 [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Getting Started

### Types import convention

This project re-exports generated OpenAPI TypeScript types from `app/frontend/app/types/index.ts` (the generated file is `generated-api.ts`). For cleaner and stable imports across the codebase, prefer importing types from the `types` module instead of referencing the generated file directly.

Examples:
- From a route or component one level under `app/frontend/app`, use:
```ts
import type { components } from "../types";
```

- From other locations adjust the relative path accordingly, but the idea is to import from the `types` index which re-exports the generated types:
```ts
// re-exported public surface:
import type { components } from "app/frontend/app/types";
```

Keeping imports pointed at the `types` index makes it safe to regenerate `generated-api.ts` without changing imports throughout the codebase, and centralizes any small normalization or helper exports that wrap the generated shapes.

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
